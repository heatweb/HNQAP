Heat Network Quality Assurance Procedures

This project contains documents, tools and data used in quality assurance procedures relating to heat networks and zero-carbon building services technologies.

As well as guidance documents, the project provides open-source JSON data files that describe procedures and records outcomes. A calculations engine and conditional branching are built into the data structure to allow complex conditional procedures to be followed and recorded.
