Heat Network Quality Assurance Publications

This project contains documents, tools and data used in quality assurance procedures relating to heat networks and zero-carbon building services technologies.

As well as guidance documents, the project provides open-source JSON data files that describe procedures and records outcomes. A calculations engine and conditional branching are built into the data structure to allow complex conditional procedures to be followed and recorded.    

Quality assurance procedures are grouped by objects (object oriented), by which a set of procedures apply to a specific item in a heat network, often with a heat or water meter at entry and/or exit.  The object list is as follows.

* Network (top level object)
* Boilers
* Heat Pumps
* Buffer Storage
* Hydraulic Circuit (Primary or Secondary)
* Circulation Pump Sets
* Communal DHW Supply / Circuit
* Substation
* Property
* HIU
* BMS System 
* AMR System
* Compliance System
  
It is the aim to avoid duplication of KPIs between objects.  In this way, objects can be assembled, and a complete list of indexed KPIs obtained.
  
## Design, Installation & Optimisation

Quality control (for each object) is divided into three catagories:

* System design
* Installation and acceptance testing of systems
* Optimisation of operational systems

## Operational KPIs
